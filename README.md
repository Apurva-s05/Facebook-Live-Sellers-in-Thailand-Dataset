# Facebook-Live-Sellers-in-Thailand-Dataset
PROBLEM STATEMENT: In this project, We implement K-Means clustering with Python and Scikit-Learn. As  mentioned earlier, K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. I have used Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand  Dataset for this project. I implement K-Means clustering to find intrinsic groups within this  dataset that display the same status_type behaviour. The status_type behaviour variable  consists of posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses and links).
